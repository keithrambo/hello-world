Just another repository

I have work in 3 hours, and Im just starting a project at 11pm! This is because my kids are now just going to bed and I have about 30 minutes of free time! Im married, 5 kids, 2 dogs, 1 pig, and 9 chickens. I love soccer, and learning. I love to learn, especially about web development! Everything about it it just great! Thats me in a nutshell!
